Operators, Arithmetic and Precedence
unary or binary operator
unary acts on one (-7)
binary acts on two (7 - 2)
Operators
- Mathematical +
- Relational <
- logical or, and, not
More types of Operators
- Bitwise &
- Membership in, not in
- Identity is, is not
Arithmetic Operators and Precedence
+	Addition or unary plus	x + y
-	Subtraction or unary minus	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y
/	Division (result is always a float)	x / y
%	Modulus	x % y (remainder of x/y)
//	Floor division - results into whole number (may be float)	x // y   ## fractional part (remainder) is discarded
**	Exponent	x**y (x to the power y)
====
**	Exponentiation
~, +, -	Complement, unary plus and unary minus
*, /, %, //	Multiply, divide, modulo and whole (floor) division
+, -	Addition and subtraction
>>, <<	Right and left bitwise shift
&	Bitwise and
^ ,|	Bitwise exclusive or and bitwise or
<=, < ,> ,>=,	Relational operators
